  - by [Pete Hunt](https://twitter.com/floydophone)

React is a small library that doesn’t come with everything you might need out of
the box to build your application.

- We’re here to build cool stuff with tools that we like to
  use. 
- We’re here for the glory of shipping stuff that we’re proud to say we built.

### 1.1. - A Strong Foundation

A nice side effect of working with React is that it
can make you a stronger JavaScript developer by promoting patterns that are
readable, reusable, and testable.

- We cover foundational React knowledge to understand how to build
out a user interface with components. 
- Then we’ll learn to compose these components
and add logic with props and state. 
- We’ll cover React Hooks, which allow us to reuse
stateful logic between components.

### 1.2. - React’s Past and Future

React was first created by [Jordan Walke](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-walke-1250b634/).

React was billed as a library: concerned with implementing a specific set of features, not providing a tool for every use case.
